# space-filling-image

This is my final project for Purdue's MA 440 (Honors Real Analysis) class. Inspired by discussions of cardinality, this script takes a image, resizes it to 32x32, then follows the path of a few space-filling curves along the pixels of the image.

## z-order curves

Z-order curves are the most related to discussions of cardinality; it's an easy way to create a bijective mapping between R<sup>2</sup> and R. It turns out that Z-order curves are also the easiest to implement;
